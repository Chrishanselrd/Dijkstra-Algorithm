# Dijkstra-Algorithm
This program is designed to implement Dijkstra's algorithm, a fundamental graph algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is commonly used in transportation networks, computer networks, and other applications where finding the shortest path between two points is important.

The Dijkstra class is the core of the program, providing the necessary functionality to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. The class includes methods for building a graph, setting the start and end nodes, and running the algorithm to find the shortest path.

This program also includes methods for visualizing the graph and the shortest path, allowing users to easily understand and analyze the results of the algorithm.
